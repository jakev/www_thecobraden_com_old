_Welcome to The Cobra Den!_

This website is a place for me to discuss and share some of the mobile security research I've done as well as tools that I've created.

### Recent News

#### February 11, 2017 - Modernizing Website
After over a year since posting, the website is updated, but honestly it's not very different (if you're curious, check out the site [source](https://github.com/jakev/www_thecobraden_com)). If you've been watching the `dtf` project, you'll have seen over 200 commits to the "dev" branch. `dtf` 1.3.1 is coming!

#### June 26, 2015 - Middleman Updates + dtf Documentation
Finally another update.  I completely rewrote The Cobra Den, this time using [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/).  It was quite the learning experience, and it's way past due!  Also, check out the new [dtf documentation](/projects/dtf/)!

#### July 02, 2014 - Summer Conference Announcements
Another busy summer! I'm happy to say that I'll be hosting a workshop at BruCON 0x06 in Belgium this September, and giving a demo at Black Hat USA's Arsenal in August! Both of these appearances will fon my recent research in Android device testing, specifically in some tools I've been creating to help with the process! If you're at either conference, come stop by!

#### October 22, 2014 - TheCobraDen Moves to VPS, Upgrades to SSL
I moved the site from shared hosting, to its very own VPS, and now all traffic flows over HTTPS by default. Stay tuned for the new dtf documentation, and some updates to the CobraDroid pages!


#### May 19, 2014 - New CobraDen is Launched!
The "new" CobraDen website is up. This time, using bootstrap (bye-bye WordPress!). Note that some things are not completed yet. They will be eventually though!


#### June 24, 2013 - CobraDroid Beta Source Code Released
Almost four months later (sorry!), the CobraDroid source code for the beta is available from my GitHub account. I will be uploading additional technical documents related to the beta, then will be focusing on completing CobraDroid 1.0 by the end of the summer. Stay tuned!


#### March 07, 2013 - CobraDroid Beta Released!
The beta of CobraDroid has been released! You can get the package and learn how to use CobraDroid here. Expect the source code to follow in the coming days! The beta is still limited in features, but there are plenty more features in the works. ;)
