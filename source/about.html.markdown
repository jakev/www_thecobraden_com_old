# About The Cobra Den
The Cobra Den is my personal website dedicated to mobile security. In early 2012 I started a blog to publish some of the research I'd been working on. As time went on, I thought of more and more project ideas and decided to make a website to complement the blog. That is when The Cobra Den was born. I'd like to give back to the open-source community and provide additional tools to mobile testers.

### About Me
I'm a Senior Consultant on Mandiant's Professional Services team, based in New York, NY. I enjoy all types of security but my personal interests are mobile security and penetration testing. Outside of work I like electronic music, good food & beer, and travelling. Feel free to contact me for questions regarding this site or my projects!
